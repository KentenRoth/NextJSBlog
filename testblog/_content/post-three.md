# Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

Kids have names? No argument here. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. **Ask her how her day was.** _Aww, it's true._ I've been hiding it for so long.

## Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Fry, we have a crate to deliver. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Bite my shiny metal ass. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

1. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
2. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
3. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

### No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

-   It must be wonderful.
-   I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
-   Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.

A sexy mistake. I just told you! You've killed me! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Anyone who laughs is a communist!

It doesn't look so shiny to me. I just told you! You've killed me! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Soon enough.

Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Oh God, what have I done? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I had more, but you go ahead. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Soon enough. How much did you make me? Say what? No argument here. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You can see how I lived before I met you. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

It's toe-tappingly tragic! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. I don't want to be rescued. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

Actually, that's still true. Ow, my spirit! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
