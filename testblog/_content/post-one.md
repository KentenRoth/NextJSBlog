# I wish! It's a nickel.

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

** never loved you.** _It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years._ And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

## Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. No argument here. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

1. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.
2. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.
3. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

### Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

-   There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
-   Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
-   Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

Why yes! Thanks for noticing. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Tell them I hate them. Bender, we're trying our best. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Shut up and take my money! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

Ow, my spirit! You're going to do his laundry? Who are you, my warranty?! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Ask her how her day was. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I'm a thing.

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

It must be wonderful. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Shut up and get to the point! Ow, my spirit! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. What are their names? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? I don't want to be rescued. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Take me to your leader!

Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Bender?! You stole the atom. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
