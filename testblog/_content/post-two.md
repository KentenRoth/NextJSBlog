# Bender, quit destroying the universe!

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! ** Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!** _If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right._ If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

## I had more, but you go ahead.

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

1. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
2. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
3. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

### No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

-   Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
-   We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
-   Large bet on myself in round one.

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Who are those horrible orange men? I don't want to be rescued. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Belligerent and numerous. Professor, make a woman out of me. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Can I use the gun? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Why would a robot need to drink? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! No! The cat shelter's on to me. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. We're rescuing ya.

I'll get my kit! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. I love you, buddy! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

Kids have names? I can explain. It's very valuable. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Ask her how her day was. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

Tell them I hate them. No, just a regular mistake. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
